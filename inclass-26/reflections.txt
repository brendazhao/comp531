1.What did you hope to learn but did not? 
I once thought AngularJS is popular and we may learn that in this class. 

2.What did you really enjoy learning about? 
I enjoy the homework3. It gives us chance to use js to the field we like.Also, reduce and redux is also fun.

3.What worked well in the course? and how? 
I think the inclass exercise is great. And we can also found the slides and mp3 on the piazza.
How? The inclass exercise pushes me to learn more. And the slides and mp3 gives me a outline of learning path.

4.What did not work well in the course and how might it be improved? 
If it is possible to get the slides earlier? I found that the slides is only available about an hour before the class.
Another thing is that may be it would be better if reduced the time of new tech intro.

5.What could I have done to help you more, presentation of material, design of in class exercises, goals of projects â€“ and be specific please! 
Everything is fine!

6.Anything else you like to say?
Test Driven Programming is another thing I learned from this class! I think the workload is worth 3 credit! (even 4/5)
