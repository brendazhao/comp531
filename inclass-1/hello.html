	<p>I am a smart and hard-working girl. When I was a junior, I did a network trading platform based on QT and that is the begining of my coding road. During the past years, I took part in IBM AI Innovation Lab and did a typewriting application on Android with my team mates. I mainly took charge of building the data structure with the thought of trie and reducting the data by using VBA. Last summer, I worked as an intern in one of the biggest Internet companies--"Tencent" in Beijing. In order to improve the searching accuracy, I optimized regular expressions to match data in different websites in the news system and wrote code that can search algorithm can update atomaticly when the website's sturcture changed . All of these facts showed her plenty of practical coding experience, teamwork spirit, and good communication skills as well.
